NOTE TO ANYONE READING THIS:
This is my first attempt at creating a level of obscurity between a game controller and a video game. Eventually I'd like to be able to 'trick' a game into seeing multiple controllers as one single controller. 

Some modern games only allow input from one controller per player. This might work on a cosole, but in the world of the PC this is not ideal. An example of where this is a problem is using a flight stick and a set of rudder pedals for flying aircraft in a popular first person shooter (where the player is on a field of battle... or possibly the fourth field of battle). By default, the game will see these as two seperate controllers, and if no multi-controller support exists within the game it will force a player to pick one. The end goal of this project is to create a layer between the controllers and the game to allow for the game to see only one controller where there are multiple devices attached to the computer. If this is completed, adding macro support might be an opotion as well (to standardize generating control groups to one application instead of spread actoss multiple). 

If you stumbled across this please note that this is a learning project for me, so updates may be infrequent or may stop all together depending on my level of free time and frustration. If you have any questions, comments, ideas, threats, etc. please feel free to contact me at the email address listed above.
